    <h3>Recipe Description</h3>
    <p>
      A quesadilla is a Mexican dish consisting of a tortilla that is filled
      primarily with cheese, and sometimes meats, spices, and other fillings,
      and then cooked on a griddle or stove. Traditionally, a corn tortilla is
      used, but it can also be made with a flour tortilla.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast, diced</li>
      <li>1 (1.27 ounce) packet fajita seasoning</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 green bell peppers, chopped</li>
      <li>2 red bell peppers, chopped</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>10 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon bacon bits</li>
      <li>1 (8 ounce) package shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the broiler. Grease a baking sheet.</li>
      <li>
        Toss the chicken with the fajita seasoning, then spread onto the baking
        sheet. Place under the broiler and cook until the chicken pieces are no
        longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the green
        bell peppers, red bell peppers, onion, and chicken. Cook and stir until
        the vegetables have softened, about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer half of each tortilla with the chicken and vegetable mixture, then
        sprinkle with the Cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and Monterey Jack. Fold
        the tortillas in half and Place onto a baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake quesadillas in the preheated oven until the cheeses have melted,
        about 10 minutes.
